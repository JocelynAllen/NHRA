NHRA

This project will consist of collecting the drivers profile, racetrack statistics, and 
driver statistics over the years.

Racetrack statistics will include: name of the racetrack, date of the race, weather the day of race
Driver statistics will include: reaction time, elapsed time, lane, if they had lane choice, miles per hour,
qualifying position, time at 60 ft., time at 330 feet, time at 660 feet,  660 feet mph, and if they got
the win light. 

The files will be broken by year and car class, e.g. if looking for J.R. Todd's championship win then 
go to the 2018 Funny Car file. 

The aim of this project is to see if there is a correlation between X variable and if a driver will 
get the win. Each dataframe will be broken out by driver to gather their individual correlations.
